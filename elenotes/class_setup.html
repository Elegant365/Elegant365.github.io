                    Sharing work with others has never been easier on OneNote. It skips the tedious process of writing an email, or uploading a file, and is almost instantly accessible to the receiver.<br />
                    <br />
                    For example, coursework is an essential component for the IGCSE English Language exam. As a teacher, you’d want to have quick access to your student’s work and be able to make changes often, but without the need to constantly send emails back and forth. This is where OneNote comes into good use.<br />
                    <br />
                    With the assistance of the staff notebook, you can effortlessly share your work with your colleagues. In this situation, you will be sharing the newly moderated coursework.<br />
                    <br />
                    To create a staff notebook, you have to sign in to the official office 365 website with your school email address and password. <a href="https://www.onenote.com/edu/classnotebook/create"><b>Click here</b></a> to directly access the page which will allow you to create a notebook.<br />
                    <br />
                    You will be presented with the class notebook creation page. You need to enter in information about who and what is going to be included in your Class Notebook to get the notebook started and ready to go.<br />

                    <br />
                    With the presence of One Note, not only can you share files between you and colleagues when moderating work but also, you can give direct feedback and send the moderated pieces back to your students. Effective communication is critical, even with students as well.<br />
                    <br />
                    For this be to achievable, be sure that you are on the “class notebook” tab. Then select “manage.” A series of options are available, leave the rest for now and navigate directly to “add/remove students.” To successfully add students in, you must enter in their name or their email address for them to be invited to join this notebook.<br />
                    <br />
                    Work now isn’t only shared with ease with colleagues but also with students. The use of the staff notebook is not only efficient for the English course; on the other hand, it’s made available for all classes.<br />
